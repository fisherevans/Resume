# Fisher Evans - Resume

I set out to create a print-friendly resume for a couple reasons:

* __High availability__ Any desktop, phone, tablet, laptop, PlayStation, smart watch and Arduino can view it with no additional software.
* __Versatile__ This page can viewed as a web document, exported as a PDF or printed to physical paper. It's a win-win for all involved.
* __Customization__ With the availability of CSS, and the structure of HTML, it's easy to make my resume look exactly how I want it. It's also easy to update and swap out data. No fancy publishing software needed.
* __Fun__ Most of all, it was fun. It offered a new challenge. Most websites these days aim to support mobile phones more than anything else. Bringing it back to the root - good old paper - was a nice change.
